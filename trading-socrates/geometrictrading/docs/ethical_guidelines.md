# Ethical Guidelines for Geometric Trading
## Principles
1. **Transparency**: Declare whether analyses use native pairs (e.g., BTC/ETH) or stablecoins (e.g., BTC/USDT).
2. **Non-Exploitation**: Avoid speculative strategies that destabilize markets.
3. **Resilience**: Prioritize systemic stability over short-term gains.
4. **Diversity**: Promote diverse asset allocations to enhance robustness.
5. **Positive Emergence**: Ensure strategies contribute to market stability.
## Ethical Lock
Advanced features (e.g., futures trading) are protected by utils/ethical_lock.py, requiring users to demonstrate understanding of TGE principles and ethical commitments.
